# Neural Network
Very simple neural network for handwritten digit classification built using the tensorflow library and the mnist dataset. Uses the sigmoid activation function for the output layer with the categorical crossentropy loss function.

## Getting Started
* Install dependencies 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

* Run the neural network script in the NeuralNetwork directory
`python NeuralNetwork.py`
